<h2 id="installation-manual">Installation Manual</h2>

<p>No prior installation is required. </p>

<p>To play the game, you would require a game screen. It can be a laptop or desktop computer. Best resolution is at 1920x1080 pixels. Each player would require a handphone as the controller. </p>

<p>For certain system requirements, the game screen is best hosted on Google Chrome while the controllers are also best viewed on Google Chrome. Android phones will allow users to have maximum experience due to the ability to use the phone microphone in the game - iPhones might be less ideal.</p>

<p>On both the game screen and the controllers, go to: <br>
<a href="https://freewee.herokuapp.com">https://freewee.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>

<p>The views are calibrated based on the type of user agent â€” if the server detects that a game screen (laptop or desktop computer) is requesting for the page, it will render a game screen; if the server detects that a controller (phone or tablet) is requesting for the page, it will render a controller screen</p>



<h2 id="user-manual">User Manual</h2>

<p>After navigating to <a href="https://freewee.herokuapp.com">https://freewee.herokuapp.com</a>, players will join the room through their controllers, based on the room ID displayed on the game screen. The game supports 1-4 players.</p>

<p>Once all players are ready, click ready on the game screen and it will bring you to the game lobby where players make a game choice on the game screen.</p>

<p>Instructions for each game are loaded after choosing the game, so just follow the instructions and have fun! </p>
