NIGEL {	

	I hosted my version of the sumoPhaser with accelerometer support on a free webhost (freewee.comli.com/sumoPhaser/) because I couldn't get npm run dev --> /.ngrok to work T___T 

	I packaged my version in a different folder but also in the assets folder so that it doesn't screw up rongying's work.
